# Tag Suggestion API
This repository contains the implementation of a prototype API designed to suggest additional tags for posts. The API takes an input list of initial tags and suggests additional relevant tags to improve discoverability, engagement, and community participation.

# Project Motivation
Tags are crucial for making content discoverable. However, many users either do not tag their posts or use suboptimal tags that fail to reach their target audience. For example:

A user may use a niche tag like #orchids (1k followers) without realizing that the broader community #plantlover (189k followers) exists.
They might apply high-level tags such as #travel (24M followers) but miss out on smaller, engaged communities like #roadtrip or #national park.
This project aims to address these challenges by building an API that suggests tags to enhance post visibility and engagement.

# Features
The API offers the following features:

1. Tag Suggestion: Accepts an input list of tags (e.g., gardening, flowers) and suggests additional tags to improve discoverability. Each suggestion is accompanied by a relevance score.
2. Customization: Allows users to set a limit on the number of suggested tags (default: 5). Additional parameters can be included for flexibility in the future.

# data_processing.py: 
data cleaning and data processing. Will generate inverted index (store into inverted_indexes_full_dataset.jsonl) and forward index (store into forward_indexes_full_dataset.jsonl)
# tag_recommander.py: 
recommender algo and evaluation. Will used the inverted index and forward index generated by data_processing.py and evaluate the results using evlauation data (evaluation_data.json)
# inverted_indexes_full_dataset.jsonl: 
inverted indexes
# forward_indexes_full_dataset.jsonl: 
forward indexes
# evaluation_data.json: 
evaluation data
